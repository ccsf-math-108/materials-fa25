Imagine writing down each player's name on a card, putting the cards in an box, and shuffling the box.  Then, pull out cards one by one and set them aside, stopping when the specified sample size is reached.\n",

From that point running `sample_proportions(sample_size, population_arr)` would create an array of 2 values.
