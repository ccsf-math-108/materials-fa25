    "- **Initialize Otter.** üö® Make sure to run the code cell at the top of this notebook that starts with `# Initialize Otter` to load the auto-grader.\n",

    "    - For all the auto-graded tasks:\n",
    "        - Replace the `...` in the provided code cell with your own code.\n",
    "        - Run the `grader.check` code cell to run some tests on your code.\n",

    "    - For all the manually graded tasks:\n",

You are welcome to discuss questions with others but don't share the answers directly. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for our exams and potentially for future work in this field. If someone asks you for the answer, resist!

    "- **Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook.\n",

Otherwise, you will fail tests that you thought you were passing previously!_\n",

Originally focused on epidemics, epidemiology evolved to study the natural history of diseases and their contributing factors, with the goal of control and prevention. While it may not always resolve fundamental disease mechanisms, it helps identify key risk factors and their relative importance. Historical successes, such as John Snow‚Äôs cholera investigation, demonstrated that disease control is possible without fully understanding the underlying pathology by interrupting causal pathways. By the mid-1940s, epidemiology had proven effective in studying various health conditions, making it a promising approach for cardiovascular disease (CVD) research. \n",

    "The [Framingham Heart Study](https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/) is a landmark study that has greatly advanced our understanding of CVD. In 1947, Dr. Joseph W. Mountin, Assistant Surgeon General, Drs. Lewis C. Robinson, and Gilcin Meadors were sent to organize a heart disease study in cooperation with the Massachusetts State Department of Health, Harvard Medical School's Department of Preventive Medicine, and the Health Disease Demonstration Section of the United States Public Health Service. Launched in response to the mid-20th century rise in CVD, the study aimed to identify modifiable risk factors through a preventive approach rather than focusing solely on treatment. As public health advancements reduced infectious diseases, CVD emerged as the leading cause of death, yet little was known about its causes or prevention. Recognizing this gap, researchers set out to uncover the determinants of CVD by studying the interplay between host and environmental factors. The Framingham Study became instrumental in shaping modern epidemiology, influencing preventive medicine, and guiding public health policies.  \n",

Clinic examination data has included cardiovascular disease risk factors and markers of disease such as blood pressure, blood chemistry, lung function, smoking history, health behaviors, ECG tracings, echocardiography, and medication use. Through regular surveillance of area hospitals, participant contact, and death certificates, the Framingham Heart Study reviews and adjudicates events for the occurrence of Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Cerebrovascular disease."

    "To establish a causal link between saturated fat intake, serum cholesterol, and heart disease, a group of doctors in the U.S. launched the [National Diet-Heart Study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/575481). The study was conducted across six centers: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Oakland, and Faribault, MN. In the first five locations, volunteers from the local population‚Äîalong with their families‚Äîwere asked to modify their diets by either increasing or decreasing their saturated fat intake. The sixth center was located at Faribault State Hospital in Faribault, MN, where participants were institutionalized individuals with disabilities or mental illness. This center was led by Dr. Ivan Frantz and was part of the Minnesota Coronary Experiment. A strong advocate for reducing saturated fat to lower the risk of heart disease, Dr. Frantz was so committed to this idea that he maintained a strict low-saturated-fat diet for his own household.\n",
